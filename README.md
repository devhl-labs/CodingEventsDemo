# Coding Events Demo
This app is an asp.net demo featuring an online event website.

# State
The site has the ability to record upcoming events into a MySql database using EF Core.

# Future Improvements
Pending changes include adding the ability for users to register with the website and allow the ability to follow events and sign up to attend. This will involve a new model, view model, view, and controller.
